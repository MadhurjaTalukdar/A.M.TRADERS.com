        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem;">Some Chart Patterns Every Traders Must Know</h1>

<section style="padding: 40px;">
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: #333;">Head And Soulders:</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #66; line-height: 1;">
A head and shoulders pattern is used in technical analysis. It is a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. The pattern appears as a baseline with three peaks, where the outside two are close in height, and the middle is highest.

The head and shoulders pattern forms when a stock's price rises to a peak and then declines back to the base of the prior up-move. Then, the price rises above the previous peak to form the "head" and then declines back to the original base. Finally, the stock price peaks again at about the level of the first peak of the formation before falling back down.

The head and shoulders pattern is considered one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns. It is one of several top patterns that signal, with varying degrees of accuracy, that an upward trend is nearing its end.

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: #333;">Double Top:</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #66; line-height: 1;">
A double top signals a medium or long-term trend change in an asset class. Let's take a look at several historical examples of double tops.

The chart above is of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and shows a double top pattern that formed in the stock between September and October 2018 around a price of $2,050. The important support level in this case formed around $1,880. Despite the stock falling nearly 8% from October peak to support at $1,880, one could not confirm the double top until after the stock fell below $1,880. From that point forward the shares went on to plunge almost 31% further.

<section style="padding: 40px;">
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: #333;">Double Bottom:</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #66; line-height: 1;">
In technical analysis of financial markets, a double bottom is significant in that it suggests an important low, or strong level of support, has been reached following a down move. While the double bottom low remains in place, price movement is likely to exhibit a retracement higher and possibly indicate the beginning of a new uptrend.

 By the same token, a drop below the double bottom lows in subsequent periods suggests the downtrend is resuming and the bears have reasserted their primacy.

As with many chart patterns, a double bottom pattern is best suited for analyzing the intermediate-to longer-term view of a market.
